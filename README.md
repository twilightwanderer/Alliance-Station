Alliance Station is a fork of tgstation [/tg/station](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation) whose goal is to create a Space Station 13 build in the style of the Mass Effect universe. 

## Development status

There is a lot of work to be done to achieve the goal.
At this point, the following things need to be done:
- [ ] Adapt menus and other UI elements.
- [ ] Work on sprites.
- [ ] Develop your own map.
- [ ] Rework the game factions.
- [ ] Work on the soundtrack.

## :exclamation: How to compile :exclamation:

**The quick way**. Find `bin/server.cmd` in this folder and double click it to automatically build and host the server on port 1337.

**The long way**. Find `bin/build.cmd` in this folder, and double click it to initiate the build. It consists of multiple steps and might take around 1-5 minutes to compile. If it closes, it means it has finished its job. You can then [setup the server](.github/guides/RUNNING_A_SERVER.md) normally by opening `tgstation.dmb` in DreamDaemon.

**Building tgstation in DreamMaker directly is now deprecated and might produce errors**, such as `'tgui.bundle.js': cannot find file`.
